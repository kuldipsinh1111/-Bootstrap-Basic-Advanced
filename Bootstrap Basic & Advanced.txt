Q.9  How can one create an alert in Bootstrap? 
->  Be sure you’ve loaded the alert plugin, or the compiled Bootstrap JavaScript.

Add a dismiss button and the .alert-dismissible class, which adds extra padding to the right of the alert and positions the .close button.

On the dismiss button, add the data-dismiss="alert" attribute, which triggers the JavaScript functionality. Be sure to use the <button> element with it for proper behavior across all devices.

To animate alerts when dismissing them, be sure to add the .fade and .show classes.
